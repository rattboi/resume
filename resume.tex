\subsection*{Major Projects}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
  \headerrow 
  {\textbf{Processor Cache Simulator (Verilog)}}
  {\textbf{github.com/ekrause/0xBEEFA55}}
  \\
  I developed a simple cache simulator with a small team for the final project in a Microprocessor System Design course. It read in textfile sample trace data, and displayed cache hit/miss statistics. I predominantly developed the core logic for the N-way set associative data and instruction caches modules in Verilog.
  \item 
  \headerrow 
  {\textbf{ARM-based Audio Synthesizer (C)}}
  {\textbf{github.com/killerfriend/womprats}}
  \\
  In Industry Design Processes, I worked with a team of three other students to design and build a microcontroller-based project. We developed a microcontroller-based audio synthesizer capable of generating up to 6 frequencies simultaneously. Gathered requirements, prototyped solutions, designed and built a PCB, and implemented all of the firmware in a single, 10-week semester. 
  \item 
  \headerrow 
  {\textbf{Linux Kernel Driver (C)}}
  {\textbf{github.com/rattboi/blec\_dev}}
  \\
  In Linux Device Drivers, I wrote a Linux kernel driver in C for a USB external input/output device. It supported stable hot-plugging and removal of simultaneous devices, with separate interfaces to each device.
  \item 
  \headerrow 
  {\textbf{Video Game Console Emulator (C / ARM Assembly)}}
  {\textbf{sourceforge.net/projects/wonderboi}}
  \\
  Initially ported, then extended a PC-based emulator for a portable game console to another portable embedded platform. The final version of the emulator was almost entirely written by me.Wrote screen drawing/scaling, file access, primitive graphics caching, UI, sound, memory mapping, and more.

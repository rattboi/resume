\begin{itemize}
  \item

  {\textbf{Processor Cache Simulator}}
  {\textbf{http://github.com/ekrause/0xBEEFA55}}
  \\
  I developed a simple cache simulator with a small team for the final project in a Microprocessor System Design course. It read in textfile sample trace data, and displayed cache hit/miss statistics. I predominantly developed the core logic for the N-way set associative data and instruction caches modules in Verilog.
  \item 
  \headerrow 
  {\textbf{ARM-based Audio Synthesizer}}
  {\textbf{http://github.com/killerfriend/womprats}}
  \\
  In Industry Design Processes, I worked with a team of three other students to design and build a microcontroller-based project. We developed a microcontroller-based audio synthesizer capable of generating up to 6 frequencies simultaneously. Gathered requirements, prototyped solutions, designed and built a PCB, and implemented all of the firmware in a single, 10-week semester.

	\begin{itemize*}
    \item Silver Bay Seafoods is an Alaskan Fresh-Frozen fish processor. Wrote ladder logic for automating the plant's sensors and actuators, such as conveyor belts, hydraulic/pneumatic rams, joysticks, and heat-sealers. Developed touchscreen Human Machine Interfaces and SCADA for monitoring and controlling the automation systems, as well as data-collection middleware between the automation systems and business software using .NET and SQL.

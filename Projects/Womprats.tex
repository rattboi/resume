{
    In Industry Design Processes, I worked with a team of three other students to design and build a microcontroller-based project. We developed a microcontroller-based audio synthesizer capable of generating up to 6 frequencies simultaneously. Gathered requirements, prototyped solutions, designed and built a PCB, and implemented all of the firmware in a single, 10-week semester.

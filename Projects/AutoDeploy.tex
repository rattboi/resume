\projects{Auto Deploy (Groovy)}{(internal tool at UTi)}
{
  I completely rewrote the legacy UTi Deploy frontend tool. It uses a similar but extended specification language, and supports many new features including build artifact validation, deploy ordering, parallel deploys, simple dependency management, and simultaneous multiple deploy targets. Created Groovy-based decoupled, reusable, testable components in a shared Build and Deploy code library for future projects. This library includes a Spock test suite, Cobertura instrumentation for code coverage analysis, CodeNarc code quality static analysis, and SonarQube continuous inspection.

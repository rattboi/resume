\projects{Video Game Console Emulator (C / ARM Assembly)}{github.com/rattboi/wonderboi32/}
{
  Initially ported, then extended a PC-based emulator for a portable game console to another portable embedded platform. The final version of the emulator was almost entirely written by me. Wrote screen blitting/scaling, file i/o, graphics caching, UI, sound, memory mapping, and more.

\projects{Github Audit (Groovy)}{(internal tool at Standard)}
{
  At Standard Insurance, my team was in charge of new git repo creation within managed organizations. This included many policies around our specific branching model, branch protections, team access, and webhooks. To help manage this, I developed a tool that used the Github API to determine which repositories did not fit our current policy, and generated events to determine the best way to rectify any issues found. Some policy violations, such as incorrect repo access, were automatically rectified by the tool.

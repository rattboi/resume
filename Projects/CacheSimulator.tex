\projects{Processor Cache Simulator (Verilog)}{github.com/ekrause/0xBEEFA55}
{
    I developed a simple cache simulator with a small team for the final project in a Microprocessor System Design course. It read in textfile sample trace data, and displayed cache hit/miss statistics. I predominantly developed the core logic for the N-way set associative data and instruction caches modules in Verilog.

{
  Hoist is a repository of Ansible roles to manage the BonnyCI project. Bootstraps BonnyCI on a host of environments, including OpenStack, Vagrant, and Docker. After initializing, self-manages the continuous deployment of any changes to the Hoist repository. I added many features to Hoist, including integration with ARA (Ansible Runtime Analysis) to enable faster debugging.}

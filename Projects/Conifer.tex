\projects{Conifer Routing (Python)}{(internal tool at Standard)}
{
  To increase visibility of our developers products during build/deploy process, I created a solution that interfaces between Nagios, Jenkins, and other tools, and various messaging tools (primarily Slack and e-mail). Conifer is a Flask application that allows developers to create rules for routing messaging events to their preferred notification system. This allows teams to subscribe to build failure events, or service failures in a dev environment, for example.

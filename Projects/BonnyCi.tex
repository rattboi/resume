{
  BonnyCI is an in-progress open-source continuous integration product based on the OpenStack project's Zuul. Zuul is highly coupled to the OpenStack project and its Gerrit code review frontend, so there were many changes necessary to decouple these technologies and generalize to be usable as a GitHub integration. BonnyCI is meant for large-scale projects that have complex issues including cross-repository dependencies, and automatic gating of code commits until other dependent commits are merged.}

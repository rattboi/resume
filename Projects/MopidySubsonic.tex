  Mopidy is a music framework that decouples music service frontends and backends, e.g., it allows the use of Spotify and Youtube with a custom web frontend. I wrote an extension that allows the use of the music service Subsonic as a backend within the Mopidy framework. I maintain the Mopidy-Subsonic package on PyPI.

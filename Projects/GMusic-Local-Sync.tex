  This hobby program was written to help me sync my missing library of music to Google Music's cloud. Google has their own tool that works on audio fingerprint, but it only works on individual tracks. My music collection is album-based, so I wanted all-or-nothing import of entire albums. If Google already contains my album, use Google's version; if not, upload my local version. Determines if matches exist based on a set of heuristics, including album/artist similarity (Levinshtein distance) and filtering of extraneous keywords such as Expanded Release, Bonus Tracks, etc.
